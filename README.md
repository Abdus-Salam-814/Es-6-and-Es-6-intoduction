ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a version of the ECMAScript language specification. ECMAScript is the standard upon which JavaScript is based, and ES6 introduced significant updates and new features to JavaScript, aimed at making the language more powerful and easier to work with. Some key features of ES6 include:

const add = (a, b) => a + b;



class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
